# MorseBreaker
We were watching a movie on TV and there was a ship in the middle of war.
The Morse worker on the ship was died. And all the crew weren't know the code of Morse cause they were enrolling everyone in the war even without a good training. 
So we thought that we will make Morse Breaker which can deal with Morse code and translate it into a readable string.
We introduce Morse Breaker consists of two main parts
The Master which receive and translate the code.
The Slave which controlling the ship and if it receives a signal from The Master it will take an action.
Note:: The Generator generates the Morse code and send it to The Master.
